# Integration of Cloud Functions with LLMs for Inference Tasks

This repository provides a scalable and configurable system for integrating Google Cloud Functions with large language models (LLMs) for inference tasks. Here are the key components and considerations involved in this setup.

## A. Cloud Functions

### Features
- **Pay-as-You-Go Service**: Utilizes a function-as-a-service (FaaS) model, ensuring cost efficiency.
- **Serverless**: Eliminates the need to manage servers or containers, simplifying deployment and maintenance.
- **Trigger Type**: Employs HTTPS triggers to respond to HTTP(S) requests.
- **Authentication**: Supports both authenticated and non-authenticated invocations via Cloud IAM.
- **Runtime Configuration**: Allows for the configuration of resources such as memory, CPU, timeout settings, and autoscaling.
- **Dependencies and Integration**: Functions are crafted to process requests and seamlessly integrate with Vertex AI for utilizing LLMs.

## B. Logs Explorer

### Monitoring
- Enables comprehensive tracking of processes and errors, aiding in troubleshooting and system optimization.

## C. Vertex AI

### Features
- **Regional Availability**: Ensures that generative AI capabilities are available in selected regions.
- **Model Selection**: Assists in choosing the most suitable models for specific needs in text and image data processing.
